            <p id="academics_paragraph">As far as academics are concerned I am fairly well learned . I finished my High school studies in 2013 from Maranda High School where I was fortunate enough to score an aggregate grade of A of 82 points.

                I proceeded to do a five year degree program in Electrical Engineering at Kenyatta University. I finished the program in July of 2021 where I got a Second Class Honors Lower Division.
                
                I am  currently pursuing a Certificate at Moringa School which will take me approximately 6 months to complete.
                
                I hope to do a Masters in Electrical Engineering (Telecommunications Option) in the future and find a way to fuse it with Software Engineering for the embetterment of mankind </p>
