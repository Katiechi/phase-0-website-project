            As far as experience goes, I am a seasoned website developer who has gotten they're feet wet in languages like HTML (but we really wouldn't call this a programming language, more like a prerequisite to programming.) , CSS , JavaScript and Python. I also work with WordPress a lot.

I am also a seasoned teacher in the following subjects : Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. I am also currently at The Moringa school pursuing a Certificate in Software Engineering.

In addition I worked with a company by the name of Firstcall Technologies and gained a lot of experience in setting up security cameras and also electronics device repair.

My future goal is that I will God willing do my Masters in Electrical Engineering and be able to fuse it with Software Engineering for the good of human kind.
